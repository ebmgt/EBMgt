  paper is intended as a contribution to the ongoing conceptual development of
  sustainability-oriented innovation (SOI) and provides initial guidance on
  becoming and being sustainable. The authors organize and integrate the
  diverse body of empirical literature relating to SOI and, in doing so,
  develop a synthesized conceptual framework onto which SOI practices and processes
  can be mapped. Sustainability-oriented innovation involves making intentional
  changes to an organization’s philosophy and values, as well as to its
  products, processes or practices to serve the specific purpose of creating
  and realizing social and environmental value in addition to economic returns.
  A critical reading of previous literature relating to environmental
  management and sustainability reveals how little attention has been paid to
  SOI, and what exists is only partial. In a review of 100 scholarly articles
  and 27 grey sources drawn from the period of the three Earth Summits (1992,
  2002 and 2012), the authors address four specific deficiencies that have
  given rise to these limitations: the meaning of SOI; how it has been
  conceptualized; its treatment as a dichotomous phenomenon; and a general
  failure to reflect more contemporary practices. The authors adopt a framework
  synthesis approach involving first constructing an initial architecture of
  the landscape grounded in previous studies, which is subsequently iteratively
  tested, shaped, refined and reinforced into a model of SOI with data drawn
  from included studies: so advancing theoretical development in the field of
  SOI.</span></p>
